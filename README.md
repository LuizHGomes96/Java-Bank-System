#JAVA BANK ACCOUNT SYSTEM


 I'm learning Object Oriented Programming, so I decided to create this simple bank account system using Java. When the program is executed, the account starts with $0,00 and shows a Menu with four options:
* Check account balance;
* Deposit;
* Withdraw;
* Exit;

 The program uses a scanner to recieve input of what action you want to execute, than uses a switch statement to execute each action.
 The program also uses an If statement, to avoid that you withdraw a value higher than what's available in the account.
